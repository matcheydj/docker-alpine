The official Docker image for https://{ao}[Alpine Linux].
The image is only 5MB and has access to a package repository that is much more featureful than other BusyBox based images.

Docker images today are big. Do it yourself.
Unified images tend to scale larger.
There are a lot of ways to make them smaller, but the Docker populace still jumps to '@'ubuntu' base image for most projects.
These size savings over `@ubuntu` and other bases are huge:

There are images such as `progrium/busybox` which get us close to a minimal container and package system, but these particular BusyBox builds piggyback on the OpenWRT package index, which is often lacking and not tailored towards generic everyday applications.
Alpine Linux has a much more featureful and up to date https://pkgs.{ao}[Package Index]:

This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities, as well as production applications.

== Usage
Stop doing this:
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update -q \
  && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -qy mysql-client \
  && apt-get clean \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
----
This took 28 seconds to build and yields a 169 MB image.
Start doing this:
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine:3.16
RUN apk add --no-cache mysql-client
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
----
Only 4 seconds to build and results in a 41 MB image. Strict branch protection rules created on Github at time of update (this file).
